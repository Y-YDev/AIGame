## Rules of Awalé :

Awalé is a traditional African "sowing and capturing" game, part of the Mancala family.

**Objective :** Capture as many seeds as possible from your opponent's side.

### Board Setup
- 2 rows of 6 pits each.
- 4 seeds in every pit at the start.

### On player turn
1. Choose one of your pits on your side.
2. Pick up all seeds from that pit.
3. Sow them one by one into consecutive pits **counter-clockwise** (including the opponent's row).

### Capture Rule
- If your last seed lands in the opponent’s row, and that pit reaches **2 or 3 seeds after your drop**, you capture them.
- You may continue capturing backward in the opponent's row if those pits also hold 2 or 3 seeds.
- No capture occurs if the last seed lands in your own row or the opponent’s pit has another number of seeds.

### End of Game
- When a player cannot move (all their pits are empty), the game ends.
- Players count their captured seeds.
- The player with the most seeds wins.

### Ethical Rule
- You must always leave the opponent with a legal move. You cannot starve them intentionally.
